# Blog

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog, which is live at https://yongteng.blog/.

## Overview

This blog is a platform where I share my insights, experiences, and thoughts on various topics. The content is updated frequently, keeping it fresh and engaging.

## Technology Stack

This blog was built using a combination of powerful technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React-based framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React based web applications.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- [tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog), a template that provided a solid foundation for building this blog.

The blog is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), a deployment and collaboration platform for frontend developers.
